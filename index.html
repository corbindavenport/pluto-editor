        <p>The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was
            expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and
            twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire
            burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the
            lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our
            glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather
            than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious
            after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the
            trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the
            points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his
            earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.</p>
        <p>“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two
            ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,
            they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”</p>

        <p>“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said
            Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.</p>

        <p>““I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground
            for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of
            course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real
            existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.
            These things are mere abstractions.”</p>

        <p>“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.</p>

        <p>“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a
            real existence.”</p>

        <p>“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All
            real things—”</p>

        <p>“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube
            exist?”</p>

        <p>“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.</p>

        <p>“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real
            existence?”</p>

        <p>Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any
            real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have
            Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural
            infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we
            incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three
            which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,
            however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former
            three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our
            consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter
            from the beginning to the end of our lives.”</p>
