# pluto-editor

Pluto is a WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") text editor for [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files that runs as a Progressive Web App.

Pluto is still a work in progress, some basic functionality might be missing or broken! **Do not use Pluto with important documents.**

**Features:**

* Offline support
* Works on desktop and mobile devices
* Uses the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) to open and save local files (if supported by the web browser)


Pluto Editor uses components from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Showdown](http://www.showdownjs.com/).
